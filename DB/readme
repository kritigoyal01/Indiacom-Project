create db named "testphp"
import 2 tables named
1- "form"
2- "ci_sessions"
2 users already created for demo purpose
1- email="abc@gmail.com" password="abcd" (without "")
2- email="def@gmail.com" password="defg"

NOTE-
for creating new user dont insert number in password(sign up process)
some problem with md5 function which encrpyts the password..if that function removed,number in password works
so enter only alphabets in password while signup for time being
